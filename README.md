AI Tic-Tac-Toe game for raspberry pi

an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be 
played against an “intelligent” system. The project will span hardware and software aspects 
including the collection and interpreting of input into the system, the displaying of the game 
state after each move and implementing the intelligence of the computer player into the 
system. At the end of the project, a human player should be able to play against an intelligent 
system using the Raspberry Pi with the Sense HAT module for input of their play, 
implementation of logic and control of output.
